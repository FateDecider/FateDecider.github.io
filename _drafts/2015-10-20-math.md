title: Designing non-Hermitian real spectra through electrostatics
date: 2022-09-30 15:12:00 +0000
description: 'Non-hermiticity presents a vast newly opened territory that harbors
  new physics and applications such as lasing and sensing. However, only non-Hermitian
  systems with real eigenenergies are stable, and great efforts have been devoted
  in designing them through enforcing parity-time (PT) symmetry. In this work, we
  exploit a lesser-known dynamical mechanism for enforcing real-spectra, and develop
  a comprehensive and versatile approach for designing new classes of parent Hamiltonians
  with real spectra. Our design approach is based on a new electrostatics analogy
  for modified non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence, where electrostatic charge
  corresponds to density of states and electric fields correspond to complex spectral
  flow. As such, Hamiltonians of any desired spectra and state localization profile
  can be reverse-engineered, particularly those without any guiding symmetry principles. '
