title: Enhanced nonlinear optical response of nodal-loop materials
date: 2021-05-12 15:12:00 +0000
description: Nodal line semimetals have lately aroused much experimental and theoretical
  interest, with their gap closing along unconventional trajectories in the three-dimensional
  Brillouin zone. These trajectories or nodal lines can close into loops and trace
  out intricate knotted or linked configurations with complicated topologies. The
  semiclassical optical response of various nodal materials and toy models were studied.
  For the Hopf link model, we provide a geometric picture that sheds light on the
  effects of nodal topology and geometry of the anisotropic response surface.
