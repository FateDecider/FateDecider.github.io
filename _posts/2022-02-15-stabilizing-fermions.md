title: Stabilizing multiple topological fermions on a quantum computer
date: 2022-02-15 17:39:00 +0000
description: Using specially designed 2-fermion interactions, we demonstrate how multiple
  topological fermions can coexist in quantum many-body systems on a quantum computer.
  Our work showcases how advances in quantum algorithm implementation enable noisy
  intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices to be exploited for topological stabilization
  beyond the context of single-particle topological invariants.
