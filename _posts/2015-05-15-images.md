title: Simulation of interaction-induced chiral topological dynamics on a digital
  quantum computer
date: 2022-09-27 21:01:00 +0000
description: Chiral edge states are highly sought after as paradigmatic topological
  states relevant to both quantum information processing and dissipationless electron
  transport. Using superconducting transmon-based quantum computers, we demonstrate
  chiral topological propagation that is induced by suitably designed interactions,
  instead of flux or spin-orbit coupling. Also different from conventional 2D realizations,
  our effective Chern lattice is implemented on a much smaller equivalent 1D spin
  chain, with sequences of entangling gates encapsulating the required time-reversal
  breaking. By taking advantage of the quantum nature of the platform, we circumvented
  difficulties from the limited qubit number and gate fidelity in present-day noisy
  intermediate-scale quantum era quantum computers, paving the way for the quantum
  simulation of more sophisticated topological states on very rapidly developing quantum
  hardware.
