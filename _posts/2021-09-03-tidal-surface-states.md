title: Tidal surface states as fingerprints of non-Hermitian nodal knot metals
date: 2021-03-09 15:12:00 +0000
description: Non-Hermitian nodal knot metals (NKMs) contain intricate complex-valued
  energy bands which give rise to knotted exceptional loops and new topological surface
  states. We introduce a formalism that connects the algebraic, geometric, and topological
  aspects of these surface states with their parent knots. We identify the surface
  state boundaries as “tidal” intersections of the complex band structure in a marine
  landscape analogy. Beyond topological quantities based on Berry phases, we further
  find these tidal surface states to be intimately connected to the band vorticity
  and the layer structure of their dual Seifert surface, and as such provide a fingerprint
  for non-Hermitian NKMs.
